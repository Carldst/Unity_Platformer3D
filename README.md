2nd Unity Game - Labs of Computer Graphics [M2 Virtual and Augmented Reality]

It's a simple game based our own course. It permits me to discover the basic of unity in all aspects.

By downloading build you could run the game. In the other repository you have all the Unity project.

You also have access to a funny trailer, enjoy !
